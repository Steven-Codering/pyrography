			<h2 class="text-warning">Ventilation:</h3>
			<p class="text-light">
				Work in a well-ventilated area to disperse any fumes produced during the burning process.<br>
				Proper ventilation reduces the risk of inhaling potentially harmful vapors.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Protective Gear:</h4>
			<p class="text-light">
				Wear appropriate protective gear, including safety glasses to shield your eyes from sparks<br>
				or wood particles. If you're working for an extended period, consider using a dust mask to avoid
				inhaling
				wood dust.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Fire Safety:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Keep a fire extinguisher nearby and familiarize yourself with its proper usage. Pyrography<br>
				involves working with hot tools and wood, making it essential to be prepared for potential fire hazards.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Heat-Resistant Surface:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Place your pyrography tools on a heat-resistant surface when not in use. Ensure that the<br>
				surface is stable and won't easily tip over, preventing accidental burns or fires.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Temperature Control:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Familiarize yourself with the temperature controls of your pyrography pen, and adjust them<br>
				according to the type of wood and the effect you want to achieve. Avoid using excessively high<br>
				temperatures to minimize the risk of burns or fire.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Work in a Clutter-Free Area:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Keep your workspace organized and free from clutter. This reduces the risk of accidents,<br>
				such as knocking over tools or inadvertently touching hot surfaces.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Proper Lighting:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Ensure adequate lighting in your workspace to see your work clearly and avoid accidental<br>
				injuries. Proper illumination reduces the chances of making mistakes that could lead to injuries.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Avoid Flammable Materials:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Keep flammable materials, such as paper or cloth, away from your work area. Sparks or hot<br>
				tools can easily ignite these materials, leading to fire hazards.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Take Breaks:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Pyrography requires concentration and precision. Take regular breaks to prevent fatigue,<br>
				which can lead to accidents. Staying alert and focused is crucial for safety.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Read and Follow Instructions:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Always read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for your pyrography tools. This<br>
				includes guidelines for usage, maintenance, and safety precautions.
			</p>
			<h2 class="text-warning">Children and Pets:</h2>
			<p class="text-light">
				Keep children and pets away from your workspace to prevent accidental burns or injuries.<br>
				The tools and materials used in pyrography are not suitable for unsupervised use by children.
